            ONU is a strategic card based rougelike that builds upon the game of UNO.
            The player must battle increasingly difficult enemies in UNO games and can make use of
            dynamic rule cards that change how the game is played. Additionally the player can upgrade
            their deck to add new cards or upgrade existing ones.  A different randomly generated map
            is created for each new game. Therefore the player will always have a different experience
            and can choose different strategies based on their upgrades and rule cards.

            The game will further develop by having more areas to explore when the player finishes
            the first area. We will also add more enemies, more rule cards, and more types of upgrades
            for the deck. We will improve the balancing of the rule cards. More art, sounds will be 
            fun to add to the game.
