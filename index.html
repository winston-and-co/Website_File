        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          ONU is a strategic game that adds a roguelike twist to the famous
          party game UNO. In order to become the world&apos;s greatest ONU
          player, the player must defeat increasingly difficult opponents.
        </p>
        <h3>Change the <span class="keyword-red">Rules</span></h3>
        <p>
          In ONU, players bring their own house rules to every match in the form
          of <span class="keyword-red">Rule Cards</span>.
          <span class="keyword-red">Rule Cards</span> change how the game is
          played, from letting you play mismatching colors to drawing extra
          cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also pick up powerful
          <span class="keyword-blue">Action Cards</span>&mdash;powerful, single
          use cards that can change the tides in a single play. (E.g.
          <span class="keyword-blue">Wild Card</span>)
        </p>
        <h3>Each run is different</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout a run, you will encounter events and gain upgrades that
          give you an edge in battle. You might add or remove cards, or upgrade
          existing ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map is also randomly generated each time, meaning you&apos;ll have
          to be creative and find the best path.

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          The game will further develop by having more areas to explore when the
          player finishes the first area. We will also add more enemies, more
          Rule Cards, more Action Cards, and more types of upgrades for the
          player. Of course, we also plan to add sounds and more art. While we
          want to have players learn as they go, we plan to add a bit more to
          the new player experience, in order to give them a better
          understanding of how to play.
